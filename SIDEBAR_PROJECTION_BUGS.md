# Sidebar Projection Bug Hunt

This file records distinct bugs found by deterministic sidebar projection/hydration hunts.

Projection discovery is separate from runtime reconciliation trace hunting. Runtime `RT-*` findings stay in `RUNTIME_TRACE_BUGS.md`; projection findings use `PT-*`.

Run projection discovery with:

```sh
pnpm exec playwright test tests/playwright/sidebar-projection-hunt.spec.ts --reporter=list
```

Fix passes must satisfy correctness and the hard projection perf gate:

```sh
pnpm perf:sidebar-projection-guard
```

## Last Projection Run

- Completed: 2026-05-25
- Strategy: sidebar projection boundary discovery
- Scenario ids: 13 `psh-*` Playwright discovery scenarios
- Distinct findings recorded: 1
- Status: hunt in progress; failing scenario frozen for later fix pass

## Finding Index

- Open projection findings: `PT-001`

### PT-001 rejected sparse slice leaves viewport blank/no retry

- Status: open
- Found by: `psh-scroll-rejected-slice-recovers-without-second-user-scroll`
- Repro:

```sh
pnpm exec playwright test tests/playwright/sidebar-projection-hunt.spec.ts --grep "psh-scroll-rejected-slice-recovers-without-second-user-scroll" --reporter=list
```

- Expected: after a `getTreeProjectionSlice` request rejects, the sidebar should request or retry the current viewport slice and repaint without requiring another user scroll.
- Actual: the sparse request count remains `1`, and the scrolled viewport stays blank.
- Evidence: the scenario rejects the first sparse slice after scrolling to row `250`; after idle frames, Playwright observes no retry and no visible row `250`.
